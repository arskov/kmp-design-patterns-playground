# Playground for Kotlin Multiplatform code

## Setting up

1. For playing with mobil platforms install Android Studio and XCode. Assuming you are on the Mac machine.
1. Set up the Android SDK location via either ANDROID_HOME or create the local.properties file and put
```properties
sdk.dir=/Users/USERNAME/Library/Android/sdk
```
1. Set up the TODO to avoid "Xcode does not support simulator tests for ios_x64. Check that requested SDK is installed"
